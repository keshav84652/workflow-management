# Ctrl+Filing: Transforming Tax Preparation with AI

Accounting professionals face a growing challenge: clients expect faster service and more strategic advice, yet tax preparation remains bogged down by manual processes. The average tax return requires over 10 hours of tedious document organization, data entry, and reconciliation work. This manual approach not only consumes valuable time but introduces significant error risk, with IRS data showing that preparation errors trigger more than a third of all audits.

Ctrl+Filing eliminates the grunt work in tax preparation so CPAs can focus on actual strategy and review. Our AI-powered platform transforms days of manual labor into minutes of supervised automation, allowing accounting professionals to dramatically increase their capacity while improving accuracy.

At the core of our solution are three powerful AI engines that address the most time-consuming aspects of tax preparation:

**TaxPrep Bot** automatically classifies tax documents like W-2s, 1099s, and K-1s, then extracts relevant data with 95% accuracy. The system populates tax forms without manual entry, eliminating hours of tedious work and reducing input errors. When the system encounters ambiguous information, it flags it for human review rather than making assumptions, ensuring accuracy while still saving time.

**TicTie Slayer** generates audit-ready workpapers that automatically cross-reference source documents with final returns. This creates a defensible documentation trail for all calculations and ensures nothing falls through the cracks. The system maintains these connections even as documents are updated, eliminating the need to manually verify ties when information changes.

**Recon Wizard** performs AI-driven reconciliation between financial statements, prior returns, and current-year documents. The system automatically flags discrepancies and suggests corrections, reducing the risk of errors and providing clear documentation of all reconciliation steps. The output is fully compatible with Excel, allowing for seamless integration with existing workflows.

Coming soon, we'll be releasing additional modules including Smart Mail for email classification and data extraction, Workflow Hub for AI-optimized task management, Call Capture for client conversation documentation, and Pocket Portal for an enhanced mobile client experience.

The impact for accounting firms is transformative: 80% reduction in document processing time, 90% decrease in data entry errors, 50% faster client turnaround times, and a threefold increase in capacity during tax season. Most importantly, Ctrl+Filing frees accounting professionals from low-value tasks so they can focus on providing the strategic advice and insights that truly matter to clients.

Ctrl+Filing delivers organized digital workpapers, comprehensive reconciliation reports, and e-file ready outputs that can be directly imported into tax preparation software. The entire system is designed by tax professionals for tax professionals, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with existing processes while dramatically improving efficiency.

In an industry where time literally equals money, Ctrl+Filing gives accounting professionals the one resource they can never get enough of: time. By automating the most tedious aspects of tax preparation, we're not just improving efficiencyâ€”we're transforming the entire profession, allowing CPAs to focus on the high-value work they were trained to do.
