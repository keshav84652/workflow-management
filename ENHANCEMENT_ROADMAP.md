## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a comprehensive enhancement strategy that can significantly improve the CPA WorkflowPilot application. The parallel track approach allows for efficient development while maintaining focus on different aspects of the system.

Priority should be given to Track A1 (technical debt) and Track D1 (security) as foundational improvements, followed by user-facing enhancements in Track B and advanced features in Track C.

Each track is designed to be independent, allowing for flexible resource allocation and parallel development by multiple team members.
