CPA COPILOT INCOME AGGREGATION FIX - COMPLETION SUMMARY
========================================================

üîß ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

1. **INCOME AGGREGATION TOOL BUG** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Problem: Tool was looking for "InterestIncome" field but Azure data has income nested under "Transactions[0].Box1"
   - Solution: Added _extract_income_from_azure_transactions() method to properly handle nested Azure data structure
   - Impact: Now correctly extracts $123,456 from 1099-INT documents

2. **SESSION STATE MANAGEMENT** ‚úÖ IMPROVED
   - Problem: Old files from previous sessions persisting
   - Solution: Created cleanup_session.py script to remove old files and reset state
   - Impact: Cleaner document management and fewer false positives

3. **FIELD MAPPING FOR ALL 1099 TYPES** ‚úÖ ENHANCED
   - Added proper extraction for:
     * 1099-INT: Box1 (Interest Income)
     * 1099-DIV: Box1a or Box1 (Dividends)
     * 1099-G: Box1 (Government Payments)
     * 1099-NEC: Box1 (Nonemployee Compensation)
     * 1099-MISC: Box1, Box3, or Box7 (Various Income)

üìÅ FILES MODIFIED:
- backend/agents/tax_document_tools.py (Fixed IncomeAggregatorTool)
- Created: fix_income_aggregation.py (Test and validation script)
- Created: cleanup_session.py (Session management script)

üß™ TESTING COMPLETED:
‚úÖ Test extraction function returns correct $123,456 from sample data
‚úÖ Session cleanup removes old files properly
‚úÖ Azure transaction structure parsing works correctly

üìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
When user asks "What is my total income?" the AI should now:
1. Find the 1099-INT document
2. Extract $123,456 from Transactions[0].Box1
3. Categorize it as "interest" income
4. Display: "Your total income from all sources is $123,456.00"

üîÑ NEXT STEPS FOR TESTING:
1. Restart Streamlit app
2. Clear session state in app
3. Upload only current 3 documents
4. Process documents  
5. Ask: "What is my total income?"
6. Verify $123,456 is correctly calculated

üìã TECHNICAL DETAILS:
The fix addresses the mismatch between expected field names and actual Azure API response structure:

OLD (BROKEN):
```python
interest = doc.azure_result.fields.get("InterestIncome", 0)
```

NEW (FIXED):
```python
transactions = doc.azure_result.fields.get("Transactions", [])
if transactions:
    interest = transactions[0].get("Box1", 0)
```

This properly handles the nested structure that Azure Document Intelligence returns for tax forms.
