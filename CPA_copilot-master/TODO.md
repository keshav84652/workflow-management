# CPA Copilot - TODO List

## URGENT FIXES NEEDED (Current Session)

### Critical Errors to Fix
- [ ] **Fix runtime errors in app** - Need to identify and fix any import errors or runtime issues
- [ ] **Test income calculation flow** - Ensure IncomeAggregatorTool works properly with both Azure and Gemini data
- [ ] **Verify agent tool call flow** - Make sure all agent tools execute without errors
- [ ] **Test API call logging** - Ensure debug_logger captures all API requests/responses properly
- [ ] **Add missing download options** - Need separate download for API data vs chat history

### Verified Working Features
- [x] **Debug tab exists** - Already implemented with comprehensive API and tool monitoring
- [x] **Debug logger implemented** - Comprehensive logging for API calls and tool executions
- [x] **App structure is good** - Main app.py is well-organized with all necessary components

### High Priority Issues
