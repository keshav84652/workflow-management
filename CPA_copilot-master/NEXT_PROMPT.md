# NEXT PROMPT FOR CPA COPILOT TESTING

## üéØ **URGENT: Test the Income Aggregation Fix**

The income calculation bug has been fixed! Your AI agent was returning $0 income because it was looking for the wrong field names in the Azure data. I've fixed the extraction logic to properly handle the nested transaction structure.

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE TESTING STEPS:**

1. **Restart your Streamlit app** (Ctrl+C then restart)
2. **Clear session state** - use "Clear All" button in Upload tab
3. **Upload ONLY these 3 documents:**
   - TAX-1099-INT.png 
   - TAX-1098-E.png
   - TAX-1098-T.png
4. **Process the documents** with default settings (Azure + Gemini enabled)
5. **Test the AI agent** with this exact question: 

## üí¨ **TEST QUESTION:**
```
"What is my total income?"
```

## ‚úÖ **EXPECTED RESULT:**
The AI should now correctly respond with:
- **Total Income: $123,456.00** (from your 1099-INT interest income)
- Breakdown showing "Interest: $123,456.00"
- Reference to the 1099-INT from CONTOSO BANK

## üîß **WHAT WAS FIXED:**
- Income aggregation tool now properly extracts from `Transactions[0].Box1` instead of looking for non-existent `InterestIncome` field
- Session cleanup removes old files from previous sessions
- All 1099 form types now have correct field mapping

## üìù **AFTER TESTING, PLEASE REPORT:**
1. Did the income calculation work correctly?
2. Any other issues you notice?
3. Are there any remaining features needed for your MVP?

## üèóÔ∏è **POTENTIAL NEXT STEPS:**
If the income calculation works, we could focus on:
- Adding more sophisticated tax analysis features
- Improving workpaper generation
- Adding validation rules for different tax scenarios
- Building out the conversation capabilities of the AI agent

Test this fix and let me know how it goes!
