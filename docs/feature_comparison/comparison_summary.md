## Recommendations for Workflow Management Expansion

Based on this comparison, here are some potential areas for expanding the features of the `workflow-management` application:

*   **Enhanced Collaboration**: Implement real-time notifications (like Focalboard's WebSocket-based system) to provide immediate feedback to users when changes are made. Add support for @mentions in comments to notify specific users.
*   **Gantt Charts and Roadmaps**: Add Gantt chart and roadmap views to provide a visual overview of project timelines and progress. This is a key feature in OpenProject and Vikunja.
*   **Agile Boards**: Implement Kanban and Scrum boards to support agile workflows. This is a core feature in Focalboard, Vikunja, and Plane.
*   **Desktop Application**: Consider creating a standalone desktop application (similar to Focalboard's Personal Desktop edition) for offline access and improved user experience.
*   **Integrations**: Expand the integration capabilities to connect with other tools, such as email clients, calendars, and document storage services. Plane's integration with GitHub, GitLab, and Slack is a good example.
*   **Customizable Dashboards**: Allow users to create custom dashboards with different widgets to visualize project data. OpenProject's dashboard is a good reference.
*   **Public API**: Expose a public API to allow third-party developers to build integrations and extend the functionality of the application.
