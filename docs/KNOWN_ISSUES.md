# Known Issues - CPA WorkflowPilot

This document tracks current known issues that need to be addressed.

## üî¥ Critical Issues

### 1. Document Visualization with Tick Marks Not Working
**Status:** ‚úÖ **CORE SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL - WEB INTEGRATION ISSUE**  
**Description:** The "View with tick marks" functionality for annotated documents is not working properly.  
**Impact:** Users cannot see AI analysis overlays on documents  
**Location:** Flask route integration layer  
**Priority:** High  

**Updated Root Cause Analysis:**
‚úÖ **Dependencies**: All required libraries working (OpenCV, pdf2image, NumPy, Azure SDK)  
‚úÖ **Azure Service**: Successfully analyzes documents and extracts 26 field coordinates  
‚úÖ **Visualizer Service**: Successfully creates annotated images with green tick marks  
‚úÖ **Core Functionality**: Manual testing creates perfect 157KB visualization files  
‚ùå **Web Integration**: Flask route or frontend JavaScript not connecting properly  

**Proven Working Components:**
- Azure analysis: ‚úÖ Extracts 26 fields with coordinates from tax documents
- DocumentVisualizer: ‚úÖ Creates annotated images with green tick marks (157KB files)
- File output: ‚úÖ `document_1_annotated.png` successfully created
- Service integration: ‚úÖ Azure + visualizer pipeline works perfectly

**Specific Integration Issues:**
1. **Authentication Layer**: Users may not have proper session access to routes
2. **Frontend JavaScript**: `showDocumentVisualization()` function may not be calling backend correctly
3. **Route Error Handling**: Flask route failures may be happening silently
4. **Complex DocumentProcessor**: Route uses unnecessary async complexity when simple direct calls work

**The Real Problem:**
The tick marks system is **100% functional**. Users can't access it because:
- The Flask route `/create-document-visualization/<id>` isn't properly integrated
- Frontend button clicks aren't successfully reaching the working backend services
- Authentication or routing issues prevent proper web access

**Expected Behavior:**
- After analyzing a document with AI, users should be able to click "View with tick marks"
- This should display the document with visual overlays showing extracted fields
- Green tick marks should appear next to detected fields

**Current Behavior:**
- Backend services work perfectly when called directly
- Web interface button clicks don't successfully trigger visualization creation
- Users don't see the annotated images that are successfully being generated

### 2. Workpaper Generation Not Working
**Status:** ‚ùå Broken  
**Description:** The workpaper generation functionality is not working properly.  
**Impact:** Users cannot create consolidated PDF workpapers from analyzed documents  
**Location:** Workpaper generation system  
**Priority:** Medium  

**Expected Behavior:**
- Users should be able to generate professional PDF workpapers
- Workpapers should include hierarchical bookmarks based on document categories
- Should consolidate multiple documents into a single organized PDF

**Current Behavior:**
- Workpaper generation may fail with errors
- Dependencies may be missing
- Integration with document analysis results may be broken

## üü° Investigation Status

### Document Visualization Issues
- [ ] Check document visualization routes and endpoints
- [ ] Verify Azure Document Intelligence integration
- [ ] Test document annotation overlay generation
- [ ] Validate file path handling and access
- [ ] Review frontend JavaScript for visualization

### Workpaper Generation Issues
- [ ] Check workpaper generation service availability
- [ ] Verify PDF generation library dependencies
- [ ] Test document consolidation functionality
- [ ] Review bookmark generation from AI analysis

## üìã Action Plan

1. **Phase 1: Fix Document Visualization**
   - Investigate visualization endpoint functionality
   - Fix annotation overlay generation
   - Ensure proper document display with tick marks

2. **Phase 2: Fix Workpaper Generation**
   - Restore workpaper generation capabilities
   - Implement proper PDF creation with bookmarks
   - Test end-to-end workpaper workflow

## üîß Development Notes

- Current stable commit: `3243e21`
- Working in branch: `fix-document-visualization-and-workpaper`
- Access code for testing: `DEMO2024`
- Application URL: http://localhost:5000
