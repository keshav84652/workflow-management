---

## ✅ Completed Integration Work

### 1. Dashboard Service Decomposition - **COMPLETE**
- ❌ **Old monolithic `services/dashboard_service.py`**: **REMOVED** ✅
- ✅ **New `DashboardAggregatorService`**: **FULLY INTEGRATED** ✅
- ✅ **Blueprint Integration**: `blueprints/dashboard.py` correctly uses new service ✅
- ✅ **All References Updated**: No remaining references to old service ✅

**Verification:**
```bash
# No old dashboard service found
$ ls services/dashboard_service.py
ls: cannot access 'services/dashboard_service.py': No such file or directory

# New service properly integrated
$ grep -r "DashboardAggregatorService" blueprints/dashboard.py
from services.dashboard_aggregator_service import DashboardAggregatorService
dashboard_service = DashboardAggregatorService()
```

### 2. AI Service Strategy Pattern - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ **Strategy Pattern Implemented**: Full implementation with `AIProvider` interface ✅
- ✅ **Provider Factory**: `AIProviderFactory` managing all providers ✅
- ✅ **Concrete Providers**: `AzureProvider` and `GeminiProvider` implemented ✅
- ✅ **Service Integration**: `AIService` uses strategy pattern throughout ✅
- ✅ **Blueprint Integration**: `blueprints/ai.py` uses new service ✅
- ✅ **Worker Integration**: `workers/ai_worker.py` uses new service ✅

**Verification:**
```bash
# Strategy pattern properly implemented
$ ls services/ai_providers/
__init__.py  azure_provider.py  base_provider.py  gemini_provider.py  provider_factory.py

# All components using new AI service
$ grep -r "from services.ai_service import AIService" --include="*.py"
app.py:from services.ai_service import AIService
blueprints/ai.py:from services.ai_service import AIService
workers/ai_worker.py:        from services.ai_service import AIService
```

### 3. Event Schema Registry - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ **Registry Implementation**: Comprehensive `EventSchemaRegistry` class ✅
- ✅ **Event Documentation**: Full event flow documentation system ✅
- ✅ **Handler Management**: Priority-based handler registration ✅
- ✅ **Dependency Tracking**: Event dependency graph implemented ✅

**Verification:**
```bash
# Event registry fully implemented
$ wc -l events/registry.py
517 events/registry.py

# Modern event schemas in place
$ grep -r "BaseEvent" events/schemas.py
class BaseEvent:
```
